Contract creation for V2.0.2 is taking 4eva... and I realized there
was a bug (forgot to do modulo in getRandomNumber). Bug fix in V2.0.3.

I guess I'll just go ahead and implement block time based unpausing
etc while waiting for V202 to deploy...

V2.0.4 includes unpausing the holders,public mints based on block
timestamp and same with reveal time.

I guess next I'll try to add weth as a payment method :)

V2.0.8 weth payment still is failing.
V2.0.9 will just test minting out on Rinkeby and maybe I'll ignore
minting with weth for now...
