The main purpose of V2.0.1 is to upgrade the minting dapp used in
V2.0.0 (which I actually kept in V1.0.1) to allow for Coinbase wallet
connectivity -- and then to improve the ability for people to check
if their V1 token can claim a V2 token or not.

Note, Chrome doesn't show my favicon...Brave does though...maybe
for Chrome I just need to reset the cache?
  Favicon all good for fresh Firefox window (quit it first) so yeah
probably just Chrome remembering the tutorial React dapp.

athena configure line:
  python configure.py --prob rt --flux hllc -hdf5 -mpi

Notes to self:
  I'd say 16x32 is obviously quite coarse but it can be a 1/1 again :)

32x64 is maybe my favorite but 64x128 looks good at the start too.
It'll be good to run a 128x256 run for longer but will take ~30 minutes
and it'd be nice to do a 256x512 but I guess that'll take a few hours.
And then 512x1024 maybe overnight? Possibly out of reach of single core.

I'd like to modify athena source to allow numerically unstable runs.
Also I want to look up what iprob, amp, and drat parameters do.

Also I want to play around with gamma and grav_acc2 parameters.

Was about 3 minutes to run grav_acc2 = -0.69 (grav_acc2 = -0.1 fiducial)
at 64x128 resolution.

Okay, so that basically sped up the evolution of the sim 6.9x which
is great news regarding evolving some high resolution runs cheaper
but it's a boring parameter to sweep unfortunately. Also for the 64x128
run it evolves really rapidly such that most of the simulation time
it's already reached a steady state so kind of boring.

Next let's try modifying gamma (default is 1.4 so I'll change it to
1.333333 for a relativistic gas and then 1.666666666 for an ideal gas.
And maybe a few other values.
  I just tried 1.69 and there's a subtle but not obvious difference
so I'll save modifying gamma for later (I'll probably just do 1.4
the fiducial, 1.69 as a 1/1, 1.33s as relativistic gas and 1.66s as
ideal gas.

Okay next, I'll look at iprob, amp, and drat.
  Pretty sure drat is density ratio so similar to grav, if I
increase the density ratio it'll evolve faster and if I decrease
the density ratio it'll evolve more slowly.
  amp is likely the amplitude of the initial perturbation.

According to rt.cpp, iprob = 1 is single mode, iprob != 1 is multiple
mode perturbation. (more options for 3d)

I think I'll want to modify kx,ky to have more than one finger.

For now I'll just try drat = 6.9
  Then I'll try iprob != 1

Then I'll include magnetic fields. Then I'll modify the period.

512x1024 took 18.5 hours and didn't quite get there before I had to
close my laptop. I mean it def went far enough (like t=48) jut not
the full tlim=69.

Next I'll try iprob != 1, then with magnetic fields, then I'll change
the wavelength of the perturbation.

Oh and I also want to tweak athena to allow unstable cfl numbers.

iprob != 1 looks pretty cool! Although it saturates early. I guess
it's effectively the case of a really short period for the perturbation.

Need to plot the case with B-fields turned on next. The next run
I'll do will be with wavelength of the perturbation 1/2 the fiducial
(and I'll double the width of the box). I think some iprob != 1 with
a square box would look cool too.

The B-field case is v boring (since B fields suppress the instability
but might also just be too low resolution). I'll try increasing
the gravitational acceleration and see if that makes things more
interesting --- oooo! I can also make the b-fields weaker! I'll
do that first. Set it to 0.1 and then I'll try 0.01 (so plasma beta
proably = 10 and then 100 ;) ).

While that's running I'll go modify the perturbation wavelength and
call that rt2

b0 = 0.1 was sadly also boring. Next up b0 = 0.01! If it looks cool,
great! If not, I'll set grav_acc2 to -0.69 again...

b0 = 0.01 evolved! I think it probably won't look *that* cool tho...
I'll try b0 = 0.069 next. Then b0 = 1 and grav_acc2 = -0.69
(and if that's boring, b0 = 0.1 with grav_acc2 = -0.69), then I'll
try the period = 0.5 etc runs.

While that stuff is running I'll work on allowing for unstable cfl
numbers. Besides cfl I also want to runs some with different
Riemann solvers. Then I think I'll just need to play with colormaps
and be done!

b0 = 0.069 was boring -- I'll try it with grav_acc2 = -0.69.
Then I'll try period = 0.5 etc runs. I'll do unstable cfl stuff
more likely when I have internet (need to remember how to gdb).

b0 = 0.069 w/ grav_acc2 = -0.69 evolved. But as usual with
b-fields kinda boring due to suppression of the instability.

I'll just do one more b-field case with iprob!=1 then switch
to different periods and then do the different riemann solvers.
Then I'll just mix and match parameters I've already run
(currently at 16 runs so I really don't need that many more imo...
and I do want at least one numerically unstable case ideally).

Still kinda meh for b-fields w/ iprob !=1. Anyway, now to
modifying the period for non-bField cases!
