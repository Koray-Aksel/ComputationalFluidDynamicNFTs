The purpose of this project is to automate doing !work
commands in Gaming Ape Club and also to automate chatter to earn
Gaming Ape Club tokens for their WL marketplace. Possibly also
automatically do twitter raids and buy shit from their marketplace too.

I'd then want to expand to automatically entering giveaways and such.

I'll start out by trying to do this ~manually.

After brew install cargo (for rust):

======
To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"

llvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have llvm first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/redx/.bash_profile

For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include"
=======

After installing geckodriver using cargo:
  warning: be sure to add `/Users/redx/.cargo/bin` to your PATH to be able to run the installed binaries
