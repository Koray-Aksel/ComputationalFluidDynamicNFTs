Would be nice to make process_url_activity more efficient as it's
currently a bottleneck...

Just put what I was working on into refactored and grabbed archival
twitter_data and ScrapeTweets to here to see if it's stable.

Yup it is, saved it to archival/old/V26.

Note that the heroku version won't run on heroku b/c ast.literal_eval
of activity_by_user gets killed...I guess heroku is wimpy about it
consuming 27 MB of memory(?)

I'll add discord functionality next I guess.
