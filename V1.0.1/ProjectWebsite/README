I paid $15 for the cheapest option of webflow to build the site.
Probably there's a free option but I don't really know web design/dev.

Netlify seems to be "free" similar to fleek (300 build minutes). I also
signed up for Google Cloud Platform but I think all three are more for
deploying built sites rather than building them.

Anyway, I'm planning on building the site in webflow and then hopefully
just saving the full webpage and then tweaking it to deploy on fleek etc
and then I'll continue on fleek, jump to netlify when I run out of fleek
build minutes, then jump to GCP when I run out of netlify etc.

First thing I did was build the favicon, which I copied from the
CFD NFTs V1.0.1 hlld_256_1pt6 run with accent colormap snapshot #40.
I used imagemagick's convert command like
  convert img.png -resize 32x32 img_new_size.png

I grabbed the OpenSea logo from their website.
